## Description of different files present in the 'docs' folder


The python script 'plot_costVsIterations.py' is used to plot graph for model training in Task 2.
This code plots the variation of "Cost" with respect to "Number of Iterations"

The code takes the 'Assignment_4_Final_List_of_Cost_part-00000' file as input.

and generates the 'Cost_Vs_Iterations_Model_trainingData_task2.png' as output plot figure.

- **Assignment_4_Output_Task1_part-00000** --> output file generated by task 1 containing frequency position of the required words for LARGE dataset

- **part-00000** --> output file generated by task 2 containing 'regression coefficients' for SMALL dataset  

- **Assignment_4_Final_Output_Task2_part-00000** --> output file generated by task 2 containing following for LARGE dataset:  
. Top 5 Words with the largest regression coefficients  
. Regression coefficients   
. Final Cost  

- **Assignment_4_Final_Output_Task3_part-00000** --> output file generated by task 3 containing following for LARGE dataset:  
. F1 score   
. Number of True Positives   
. Number of False Positives  
. Number of False Negatives  
. Number of True Negatives  

- **Assignment_4_Final_List_of_Cost_part-00000** --> output file generated by task 2 containing 'values of COST across all iterations for logistic regression model' while training on LARGE dataset  

- **Cost_Vs_Iterations_Model_trainingData_task2.png** --> Plot showcasing 'Cost vs Number of Iterations' leveraging 'Assignment_4_Final_List_of_Cost_part-00000'. The plot is generated by python script 'plot_costVsIterations.py'
